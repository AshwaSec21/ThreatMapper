28,Elevation Using Impersonation,Elevation Of Privilege,Switch to vCenter,Vcenter may be able to impersonate the context of Switch in order to gain additional privilege.
27,Weak Authentication Scheme,Information Disclosure,Switch to vCenter,"Custom authentication schemes are susceptible to common weaknesses such as weak credential change management, credential equivalence, easily guessable credentials, null credentials, downgrade authentication or a weak credential change management system. Consider the impact and potential mitigations for your custom authentication scheme."
26,Authenticated Data Flow Compromised,Tampering,Switch to vCenter,An attacker can read or modify data transmitted over an authenticated dataflow.
25,Collision Attacks,Tampering,Switch to vCenter,"Attackers who can send a series of packets or messages may be able to overlap data. For example, packet 1 may be 100 bytes starting at offset 0. Packet 2 may be 100 bytes starting at offset 25. Packet 2 will overwrite 75 bytes of packet 1. Ensure you reassemble data before filtering it, and ensure you explicitly handle these sorts of cases."
24,Replay Attacks,Tampering,Switch to vCenter,Packets or messages without sequence numbers or timestamps can be captured and replayed in a wide variety of ways. Implement or utilize an existing communication protocol that supports anti-replay techniques (investigate sequence numbers before timers) and strong integrity.

19,Vcenter Process Memory Tampered,Tampering,vCenter to Switch,"If Vcenter is given access to memory, such as shared memory or pointers, or is given the ability to control what Switch executes (for example, passing back a function pointer.), then Vcenter can tamper with Switch. Consider if the function could work with less access to memory, such as passing data rather than pointers. Copy in data provided, and then validate it."

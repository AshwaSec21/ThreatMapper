27,Weak Authentication Scheme,Information Disclosure,Switch to vCenter,"Custom authentication schemes are susceptible to common weaknesses such as weak credential change management, credential equivalence, easily guessable credentials, null credentials, downgrade authentication or a weak credential change management system. Consider the impact and potential mitigations for your custom authentication scheme.","[AVP_PCyA_2103], [AVP_PCyA_2576], [AVP_PCyA_2531], [AVP_PCyA_2116]","These requirements enforce strong authentication mechanisms, password policies, and integration with centralized identity systems to mitigate weak authentication schemes."

19,Vcenter Process Memory Tampered,Tampering,vCenter to Switch,"If Vcenter is given access to memory, such as shared memory or pointers, or is given the ability to control what Switch executes (for example, passing back a function pointer.), then Vcenter can tamper with Switch. Consider if the function could work with less access to memory, such as passing data rather than pointers. Copy in data provided, and then validate it.","[AVP_PCyA_2347], [AVP_PCyA_2134], [AVP_PCyA_2535], [AVP_PCyA_2568]","These requirements ensure that memory access is restricted, secrets are protected, and only trusted code is executed."

Each requirement entry includes:
- 'Requirement ID': a unique ID 
- 'Description': the actual requirement text
- 'Assets Allocated to': a list of system components (e.g., Harvester, vCenter, VSAN...this can be different for different systems) to which the requirement applies

üü° Note: Asset names in 'Assets Allocated to' may not exactly match the asset names mentioned in the threat description.
Examples:
- A requirement might list "Switch" while the threat refers to "SwitchStack"
- A requirement might list "ESXi" or "Harvester", while the threat talks about "Hypervisor"
- A requirement might list "VSAN", while the threat talks about virtual storage

üîç Treat these as relevant if they refer to conceptually similar or related components, even if the naming differs.

‚úÖ When identifying matching requirements:
1. Prioritize semantic alignment between the threat description and the requirement text
2. Give special consideration to overlap or close match between affected assets and allocated assets, even if exact terms differ
